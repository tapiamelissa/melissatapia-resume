        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Melissa Tapia. I am a student at the University of California Riverside. I am planning to major in psychology as I love the idea of solving mysteries about the brain. I am from Ontario,California and I went to Chino High School. My favorite foods are coffee, donuts, and pastries. I love going to cafe's in my free time, especially the Hello Kitty Cafe in Orange County! I also like to dance and try new things such as sports, reading, drawing, and cooking. I love reading books such as Harry Potter, The Hunger Games and the Percy Jackson series. I also love drawing things like flowers that I see along my hikes. Cooking is one of my favorite hobbies and I like to cook things like banana bread and brownies. Occasionally I give away the brownies to my sister and her friends when they come over to hang out at my house. I think I am a very bubbly person who people can have an easy time talking to. I love making new friends and going out to try new things. Seeing so many different things to do interests me so much. New experiences are the best and with my friends here at UCR, it is just amazing and fun. My friends also say that I have a way with kids and that they always listen to me. This development made me realize that I want to help children.<br><br>

         My goal for the future is to become a psychiatrist for younger children. I truly believe that pursuing a career in child psychology will help me to promote the mental health of younger children. Childhood is an amazing time, but many vulnerabilities and challenges can have a significant impact on a child's future. Choosing this career path is much more than just treating symptoms, it's about becoming a compassionate guide and trustworthy person for children. As an aspiring specialist in child psychiatry, my mission is to create a safe space where young children feel comfortable talking about their aspirations, worries, and uncertainties without fear of being judged. It is very satisfying to be able to assist children in gaining the resilience, self-awareness, and life skills needed to overcome obstacles in life.<br><br>

        My identity has been favorably changed by my transforming experience at UCR. In terms of academics, it sharpened and broadened my mind, forcing me to investigate concepts and viewpoints I never would have considered. My view of the world has been expanded, and my character has been enhanced, by my frequent exposure to a variety of cultures, beliefs, and experiences. The difficulties I encountered strengthened my resilience and converted roadblocks become opportunities for both academic and personal development. UCR introduced me to a network of friendships that have grown into a system of support, a network of people who share similar interests encouraging one another, beyond the lectures and tests. These relationships helped in my personal growth by helping me hone my communication abilities and understand the power of teamwork.
